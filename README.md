# SSH-Hardening
This was my first project ever when i studied Cyber Security
=============================================================
This script will harden your SSH service on your machine.
USE WITH CAUTION! it's very easy to get locked out of the service if you don't know what you are doing.
Use ONLY with root user! The script doesn't support sudo commands.
If you are not a root user the script will exit on its own.
=============================================================

How to run:
1. Open a terminal.
2. git-clone this repository
3. cd SSH-Service-Hardening
4. chmod +x SSH\ Hardening.sc
5. bash SSH\ Hardening.sc
